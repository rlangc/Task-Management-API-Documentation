# Task Management API Documentation

<h3>Overview</h3>

The Task Management API allows developers to interact with a task management system. This API provides endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks, and it also supports user management and task categorization.

<h2></h2>

<h3>Base URL</h3>

All API requests should be made to the following base URL:

```

https://api.taskmanager.com/v1

```

<h3>Authentication</h3>

The API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. You'll need to obtain a valid access token to make requests.
- Authentication method: Bearer Token
- Obtain Access Token: Follow the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow to get a valid access token.

All requests to the API require an Authorization header:

```

Authorization: Bearer {access_token}

```

<h2></h2>

<h3>Rate Limiting</h3>

To ensure fair usage of the API, rate limits are enforced. Each user has a maximum of 1000 requests per hour.
- Rate Limit: 1000 requests per hour
- Rate Limit Response Headers:
- ```X-RateLimit-Limit```: The maximum number of requests allowed
- ```X-RateLimit-Remaining```: The number of requests remaining
- ```X-RateLimit-Reset```: The time (in UNIX timestamp format) when the rate limit will reset

<h2></h2>

<h3>Error Handling</h3>

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request:
- ```200 OK```: The request was successful.
- ```201 Created```: The resource was successfully created.
- ```400 Bad Request```: The request is malformed or missing required parameters.
- ```401 Unauthorized```: Authentication failed or access token is missing/expired.
- ```403 Forbidden```: The user does not have permission to access the requested resource.
- ```404 Not Found```: The requested resource does not exist.
- ```500 Internal Server Error```: An unexpected error occurred on the server side.

Error responses will include the following fields:
- ```error```: A brief description of the error.
- ```message```: A detailed message explaining the error.

Example of an error response:

```

{
  "error": "invalid_request",
  "message": "The 'due_date' parameter is missing."
}

```
